      <description>Statement Consider the problem of finding the shortest path between two points on a plane that has convex polygonal obstacles as shown in the figure. This is an idealization of the problem that a robot has to solve to navigate in a crowded environment.

 Suppose the state space consists of all positions $(x,y)$ in the plane. How many states are there? How many paths are there to the goal?</description>
