      <description>Statement Give the name of the algorithm that results from each of the following special cases:
 Local beam search with $k = 1$.
 Local beam search with one initial state and no limit on the number of states retained.
 Simulated annealing with $T = 0$ at all times (and omitting the termination test).
 Simulated annealing with $T=\infty$ at all times.
 Genetic algorithm with population size $N = 1$.</description>

      <description>Statement Examine the AI literature to discover whether the following tasks can currently be solved by computers:
 Playing a decent game of table tennis (Ping-Pong). Driving in the center of Cairo, Egypt. Driving in Victorville, California. Buying a week’s worth of groceries at the market. Buying a week’s worth of groceries on the Web. Playing a decent game of bridge at a competitive level. Discovering and proving new mathematical theorems.</description>

      <description>Statement For each of the following assertions, say whether it is true or false and support your answer with examples or counterexamples where appropriate.
 An agent that senses only partial information about the state cannot be perfectly rational.
 There exist task environments in which no pure reflex agent can behave rationally.
 There exists a task environment in which every agent is rational.
 The input to an agent program is the same as the input to the agent function.</description>

      <title>Exercise 9</title>

      <description>Statement Consider the problem of finding the shortest path between two points on a plane that has convex polygonal obstacles as shown in the figure. This is an idealization of the problem that a robot has to solve to navigate in a crowded environment.

 Suppose the state space consists of all positions $(x,y)$ in the plane. How many states are there? How many paths are there to the goal?</description>

      <description>Statement This problem exercises the basic concepts of game playing, using tic-tac-toe (noughts and crosses) as an example. We define $X_n$ as the number of rows, columns, or diagonals with exactly $n$ $X$’s and no $O$’s. Similarly, $O_n$ is the number of rows, columns, or diagonals with just $n$ $O$’s. The utility function assigns $+1$ to any position with $X_3=1$ and $-1$ to any position with $O_3 = 1$. All other terminal positions have utility 0.</description>
