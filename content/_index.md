# AIMA exercise

## Exercises for the book Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach.

**Lorem Ipsum** is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.


```bash
find . -not -path '*/exampleSite/*' \( -name '*.html' -o -name '*.css' \) | xargs wc -l
```

 It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.

With [a little bit customization](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin/blob/master/exampleSite/layouts/partials/foot_custom.html), it can easily support LaTeX math expressions, e.g.,

`$${\sqrt {n}}\left(\left({\frac {1}{n}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}X_{i}\right)-\mu \right)\ {\xrightarrow {d}}\ N\left(0,\sigma ^{2}\right)$$`

It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
